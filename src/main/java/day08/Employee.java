/**
 * An Employee that automatically receives a unique, sequential id number the
 * moment it is created. The very first Employee you create gets some id, the
 * next one gets that id + 1, and so on.
 *
 * <p>The trick is a <b>static</b> counter shared by ALL Employee objects. Each
 * time a constructor runs, it reads the counter, hands that value to the new
 * employee as its id, and bumps the counter for the next one.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 * <pre>
 *   Employee a = new Employee("Asha");
 *   Employee b = new Employee("Ben");
 *   a.getId();   // e.g. 1
 *   b.getId();   // a.getId() + 1
 * </pre>
